### Features:

    - Allows users to browse and select an image file.
    - The selected file's path is displayed in an entry field.

2. **Image Preview:**

    - Users can choose the desired output format from a dropdown menu.
    - Supported formats include: JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WEBP, JPEG, ICO, PSD.

4. **Output File Naming:**
    - Users can specify the desired output file name.

5. **Quality Adjustment:**
    - Provides a scale (1-100) for adjusting the quality of the output image.

6. **Gray Scale Option:**
    - Users can convert the image to grayscale by selecting a checkbox.

7. **Progress Bar:**
    - A progress bar indicates the status of the conversion process.

8. **Conversion Button:**

### File Generation:

Generate a single Python file named `image_converter_gui.py` containing the complete code for the image converter application. Ensure the code is well-documented with comments explaining the purpose of each section and function.
