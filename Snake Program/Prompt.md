# Input:

Create a Python 3.10 code project using the Tkinter library to create a graphical calculator application. The main features of this calculator include basic arithmetic operations, a user-friendly interface, and keyboard input functionality. Below are the specific details and requirements for the calculator application:

## Main Requirements:

User Interface:
The calculator should have a display area and buttons for digits (0-9), operations (+, -, *, /), an equals button (=), and a clear button (C).
The display area should be an entry widget where the calculation expression is shown and updated in real-time as users press buttons.
The calculator should have a modern look using the 'clam' theme.
The primary color for buttons should be teal (#008080) and the text color should be white (#FFFFFF).
The font for the buttons should be Arial, size 15.
The display area should have a font size of 18, field background color white, and text color teal.

## Functional Requirements:
The display area should show only the last 15 characters to prevent overflow.
The calculator should support basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The equals button (=) should evaluate the current expression and display the result.
The clear button (C) should reset the calculator, clearing the current expression and the display.
If an error occurs during evaluation (e.g., division by zero), the display should show "Error".

## Keyboard Input:
The calculator should support key bindings for all buttons to allow users to input numbers and operations using the keyboard.
The specific key bindings include:
Digits: 0-9
Operations: +, -, *, /
Equals: Enter and =
Clear: BackSpace, Delete, and Escape

## Implementation Details:
Use the ttk.Style class to configure the styles for buttons and the entry widget.
Ensure that pressing any button updates the display and the current expression accordingly.
Implement a function to evaluate the expression and handle potential errors.
Bind the keyboard keys to their respective functions using the bind method.

Please review the provided information and ensure the application meets these requirements.

# File Generation:

Generate a single Python file named simple_calculator.py containing the complete code for the Calculator, incorporating all the specified features and functionality.

User Guide:

Include a concise user guide within a comment block at the end of the simple_calculator.py file. This guide should explain the features and basic rules, as outlined above.

Ensure that the code is well-documented with comments explaining the purpose of each section and function.
