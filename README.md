## 100 Days of Computer-Generated Code Using LLM Models

Introduction

Welcome to the "100 Days of Computer-Generated Code Using LLM Models" challenge! This guide will help me navigate through 100 days of exploring and generating code using Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Mistral, Gemma, Deepseek Coder. The goal is to learn, recreate, and innovate using the power of AI-driven code generation.

Majority of the code will be working on Python 3.10 version
