## File Generation:

Generate a single Python file named `jigsaw_puzzle.py` containing the complete code for the Jigsaw Puzzle game, incorporating all the specified features and functionality.

User Guide:

Include a concise user guide within a comment block at the end of the `jigsaw_puzzle.py` file. This guide should explain the game's controls, features, and basic rules, as outlined above.

Ensure that the code is well-documented with comments explaining the purpose of each section and function.
